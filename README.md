# Awesome _paid_ Laravel

The ecosystem around Laravel is (not exclusively of course) known, in my opinion, of two big things: the paid offering from Laravel itself, and the wonderful community of developers and open source packages.

While I'm a lover of FOSS first, I'm something embracing paid offerings too, when I really can't find what I was looking for, or when a FOSS offering doesn't suit my needs well.

So here's an attempt to curate _awesome_ products, aimed at the Laravel community at large (or sometime made by someone from the Laravel Community), for when the need of paid software hits!

Note: official Laravel product are **bolded** in the list.
